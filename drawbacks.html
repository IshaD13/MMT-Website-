Methadone treatment clearly contains many benefits and is much safer than the choice to not do it at all, but there are also certain risks which come along with it. The patients may experience some side effects such as dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, increased perspiration, weight gain, and disturbed sleep. <br> </p>
    
        <p class="para">
	It is also risky to take Methadone and other medications simultaneously as it may cause overdose or in very extreme cases, even death. It is important to inform the doctors about any other drugs or herbal remedies the patient is taking at the time along with their treatment because they may have side effects; drugs which induce respiratory depression may heighten the effects of Methadone, and drugs which affect the metabolism system may induce withdrawal symptoms (Geneva: World Health Organization). 
<br> </p>
        
	 <p class="para">  Some people may also experience unwanted side effects if they are receiving the inappropriate drug dose, this usually occurs in the first week of the treatment. Some of these effects include: runny nose, yawning, high temperature, irritability and aggression, loss of appetite, craving for the previously abused drug (heroin in this case), etc. This occurs mostly at the early stages of the treatment when the doctors are still trying to determine what is the most suitable dose of Methadone for the patient, but the patients may react differently to dosage, potentially making them harmful, especially if the dosage is too high, however, medics do avoid doing so by starting out by a low dosage,between 10 - 20 milligrams, and then weekly increasing the dose until the dose is sufficient.
 </p>
         
	<p class="para"> Another possible disadvantage that heroin has is that it is fairly easy to abuse it, as “Any time someone uses more methadone than they are prescribed, or use it without a prescription, it is considered abuse” (Methadone Addiction and Abuse”), but however most of such overdose related accidents are due methadone being prescribed  to relieve acute pains. 	
 </p>

        	<p class="para">Patients can also often over-state their dependency and use of the dose, which encourages medics to start off with an higher dose, but that may turn out to be harmful, or in extreme cases, even lethal to the patient. There are also some other risks involved such as overdose of Methadone or incorrectly using Methadone by discarding the instructions or simply not being clear enough about them. 	
 </p>
            
        <h1 id="h1methadone2">Solutions to the Limitations</h1>
        
        <p class="para">There are currently being many plans to determine the correct dosage such as developing research and thoroughly looking at the medical history of the patient and seeing how the drug may react to their body, but however, there need to be different approach taken to the patient over-stating their use of drug. Patients need to be sat down in the first session they arrive and be told the importance of giving information as accurate as possible for the best result and be guided through the side effect is those criterions are not met to get the most accurate information possible. In this briefing few of the issues which should be discussed are: informing their doctor about any other medication being taken, including over-the-counter medications, counseling to take methadone exactly as prescribed, and to be cautious of any signs of overdose. They also need to be told about the issue of patients overstating their drug abuse history so they don’t contribute to this issue. Another solution can be for patients to tell their doctor if they are taking any other drugs such as antipsychotics, asenapine, cariprazine, etc. as they may be harmful or even lethal to the patient with the dose of Methadone they are prescribed at the moment (“Methadone”). Other methods used for a safer experience while using Methadone include but are not limited to: “updating instruction manuals, educating medical and other staff members, monitoring patients’ health while in treatment, improving procedures for take-home medications, carefully assessing each patient for the use of other drugs or medications, and reevaluating patient education procedures” (“emerging issue in use of Methadone”). The treatment should also be more individualised and the medics should start at a lower dose and increase it slowly through the treatment before lowering it again.
