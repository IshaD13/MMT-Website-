This issue can be categorised as a part of the social aspect of the society as it affects a large sum of people. The deaths caused by Methadone and the incorrect dose or any other treatment related reason is a tragic and significant number which includes individuals worldwide. It affects the world we live in, our society, and for some, even their homes. This problems also roots outside of just the individuals who were in the process of the treatment but also their families and the people they knew. This problem is tragic and should be tried to be solved immediately, but still decreases the number of Opioid-related deaths in a society.

	<p class="para"> If the issue of the rising number of deaths due to Heroin intake can be solved, many lives can be saved. Total deaths due to the use of Heroin was 15,482 in 2017 in United States. Methadone is not the perfect solution to heroin addiction, as there is none at the moment, so as a result it comes with some disadvantages, but the positive effects heavily drown the negative. Heroin drastically affects the person using it, both medically and emotionally as it may cause suicidal behaviour, mood changes, psychological dependence, etc. Some long-term medical effects of heroin are:  insomnia, infected heart lining and valves, liver and kidney disease, lung complications and mental disorders (“NIDA”), and other than that, heroin addiction also negatively affects the patients’ families and mental health. “Exposure to addictive drugs has been associated with disrupted brain white matter” (White matter connects different regions of the brain to each other), and “decreased gray matter density in the frontal cortex” (Frontal cortex being the place where most higher level thinking takes place, and gray matter takes control of muscle movement) (“The Mental Effects of Heroin: Short-Term and Long-Term”). Along with that, Heroin often brings along mental conditions such as anxiety and depression (48% of opioid users have experienced depression), and this causes dual-diagnosis, where addiction can be easily resurfaced if the patient has not properly been cured of both issues. The use of MMT will decrease all of these issue and make our society a better place to live in.</p>
