  Methadone clinics also try to help the patient in ways other than just Methadone, for example the first time a patient comes to a methadone clinic, they talk about the nature of their problem to a professional counselor or nurse, and professionals examine their medical and drug history, current situation, co-occurring disorders, and the impacts that drug abuse can bring into daily life in order to make the treatment as safe as possible. There are also one-on-one and group therapy sessions present in many methadone clinics. These therapy sessions can focus on either preventing relapse, building up a broken relationships, or dealing with stress.<br> </p>
    
        <p class="para">
The patients also well know about their treatment before beginning it, and given the safety procedure on appropriate doses, giving them some sense of safety and reassurance. The methadone treatment is personalized by a team of trained medical experts based on the principal addiction, how the patient reacts to the drug, etc (Thomas). 
<br> </p>
        
	 <p class="para">  Methadone is safe when used properly. Fighting opioid addiction is an extremely challenging task for most people, and Methadone gives the people a slow and steady way to escape their addiction. If used properly, Methadone can save lives of a variety of people who were previously addicted to Heroin.
</p>
        
	<p class="para"> MMT also has many other advantages not directly related to drug abuse but with great benefits for society as a whole such as a reduction of HIV transmission, criminal activities, unemployment rates, overdoses by Heroin, etc. Methadone is taken orally through a liquid or a pill while Heroin is often injected, and if the needles are shared or unsanitized, it can lead to HIV transmission. It also decreases the death rates associated with opioid dependency and crime relate to opioid users (“Methadone Maintenance treatment”).
</p>
        
        	<p class="para"> MMT is also safer to take than heroin as when one is in MMT, the dose and the drug and its reaction to the body as well as any side effects are closely monitored by a professional who tries to immediately fix any problems which may arise, which are unlikely if taken the correct dose by following the instructions, but he same cannot be said about heroin. Heroin addicts can easily overdose as they might not keep in account the dose that they have taken, and recently the heroin overdose statistics have hastily increased to the point that it is being called an epidemic.
